2. Complete the Assignment in Figma
   * Recreate or enhance the provided user flows and components in Figma.
   * Bring your best UI/UX practices: layout consistency, typography, color usage, and intuitive user flows.
   * We encourage you to be creative and show us your design thinking.
3. Create a Pull request with figma link
4. Interview & Review
   * We will deep dive into your design decisions, user flows, and methodology during the interview.
   * Feel free to use AI tools for generating any supporting content or prototypes. We’re interested in how you craft and reason about the design more than manual pixel pushing.
5. Any questions (our developer will answer here),

Good Luck!

We’re excited to see your design skills in action. If you have any questions, ask away on Discord. Once your challenge is complete, submit your Figma link via Pull Request and we’ll schedule the interview to review your work in detail.
