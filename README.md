# Neugence UI / UX Design Challenge

1. Fork this Repo https://github.com/neugence/designAssignment

2. Complete the Assignment in Figma
Focus on landing page only from https://aceHub.ai but level up the design.

Core Tasks
	•	Recreate or enhance the AceHub.ai landing page: structure, layout, visuals, etc.
	•	Demonstrate top-notch UX practices: layout consistency, typography, color usage, and intuitive user flows.
	•	Document your design decisions and thinking.

Additional UI Challenges
	1.	Mobile Responsiveness
	•	Show how the landing page would adapt on smaller screens (e.g., mobile or tablet breakpoints).
	2.	Design System Elements
	•	Create a mini style guide inside Figma (e.g., colors, typography, button states, spacing).
	3.	Accessibility Considerations
	•	Consider color contrast and typography guidelines for readability.
	4.	Micro-Interactions
	•	Propose at least one subtle interaction (e.g., hover states, button animations, or transitions) to elevate user engagement.
	5.	CTA Effectiveness
	•	Ensure clear, persuasive calls-to-action. Show how they might behave on hover or tap.
	6.	Iconography and Imagery
	•	Choose or create icons/illustrations that align with AceHub’s brand and overall vibe.

Feel free to personalize these challenges as long as you demonstrate thoughtful UX and UI execution.

3. Create a Pull request with figma link

4. Interview & Review
   * We will deep dive into your design decisions, user flows, and methodology during the interview.
   * Feel free to use AI tools for generating any supporting content or prototypes. We’re interested in how you craft and reason about the design more than manual pixel pushing.

5. Any questions (our developer will answer here), 
   * Discord Server: https://discord.gg/mW8xvN9qjx
